<h1>ANTIVIRUS FOR ANDROID, IS IT NECESSARY?</h1>
<p>Social networks flooded with posts about a newly released music album. Frequent chats and discussions awakened the music lover within me and I became totally agog about the music album. I started to google using my phone. There it was! A nice concerning message stating that my phone was infected with virus, recommending to install some weird antivirus apps to protect my interests. I ignored it, and somehow downloaded the album.</p>
<p>Most people use Android phones now a days. Basically Android is built on an underlying Linux Kernel, having loads of vulnerabilities. Generally malware creators target platform which are widely used all over the globe. As far as desktop computers and laptops are concerned Linux and Mac are less targeted, thereby decreasing the number of such platform targeted virus. However Windows is generally targeted when it comes to PCs. The situation is the other way round when it comes to smartphones. Android is prone to more malware attacks when compared to IOS and Windows. A study conducted in 2013 states that 97% of possible viruses are found in Android. The risk is considerably lesser in phones than PCs due to several permission checks imposed by the App market place. It may seem ideal to download an antivirus app to safeguard your phone, but many such apps demand the users to pay and opt for the premium pack for better security (which is not always necessary). The result of a study conducted in US conveys that less that 1% smartphones in US are affected by virus. However regions like Asia and Eastern Europe have more smartphone virus attacks.</p>
<p>The common vulnerabilities in Android are mentioned in Android Open Source Project (AOSP) which is an initiative created to guide development of the Android mobile platform. Every phone comes with a default setting to reject files from unknown sources. Certain apps like Quadrooter are automatically detected and disabled by Google’s default verification. Quadrooter is an app that acts like a bug and compromises the information contained in your phone. Due to the low usage of antivirus apps, they come along with extra features like password backup, lost phone finder etc. Many of these extra features are already inbuilt in Android. Thereby there is no pressing need for antivirus software in one’s phone. Many antivirus companies may recommend installing a ‘trustworthy’ Antivirus application to safeguard your phone by scanning all apps and monitoring browsing and traffic. Such applications make several irritating notifications to frequently pop up and tend to drain the phone battery. </p>
<p>It is always advised to think wisely before downloading any apps from sources other than trusted app market places like Google playstore or Amazon app market place. Downloading from third party sources is always a risk. Rooting Android phones, which is nothing but running in admin mode may lead to vulnerabilities as some malware requires this mode to perform malicious activities. Rooting has considerably reduced now days. There is no harm in having an antivirus app if the user is extra cautious about security. Else the user can simply use his wit before downloading any data. Thus the necessity of antivirus in phones is purely dependent on the utility.</p>
